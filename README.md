# Car-Rental-Service
 Car Rental Service using Object Oriented Programming.
 <br>
 The car rental management system code demonstrates strong object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. Classes like vehicle, vendor, customer, and admin encapsulate data and functionality, promoting code organization and reusability. Constructors initialize objects, while encapsulation ensures data integrity and hides implementation details. Abstraction simplifies complex details, promoting modularity, readability, and maintainability. Overall, these OOP principles collectively enable the creation of a structured and modular car rental management system.
